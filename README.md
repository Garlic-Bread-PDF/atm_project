SQL Configuration

Make sure you have MySQL Server installed on your local machine.
Using MySQL Workbench or a similar tool, open a local instance on port 3306 (username: 'root', password: 'password').
Create a new schema/database within the instance named 'atmproject'.
Now when you run the backend it should create all the required tables within the atmproject database and you should be good to go.
